<h2>Sean Campbell's first website!</h2>

Today is February 18th, my friend Teddy and I decided that it was time to learn how
create our own websites.<BR>

<h3>I am going to teach you something.</h3>

Sean Campbell was born in July of 1997!

<h3>I am going to teach you one more thing.</h3>

<h3> Let me teach you how to make crepes :) </h3>

1. You must collect:
1 Cup Flour
2 Eggs
1/2 Cup Milk
1/2 Cup Water
1/4 Teaspoon Salt
2 Tablespoon Melted Butter <BR>

2.  Begin mixing the wet ingredients and add in the dry ones. <BR>

3.  Turn on the stove and prepare yourself for excitement.  Maybe get some
powdered sugar and jelly out for toppings.  Some people even use nutella.<BR>

4.  The last step is to pour some batter on the pan and keep your eyes peeled
for golden brown goodness.<BR>
